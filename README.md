# Awesome Open-source / Free

Alternatives to paid software, which are either free to contribute, or provide basic functionality under a free license. This list should be usefull for college students, or just people that can't afford to pay licensed software.
To add a program onto the list, fork the repo, and add the software to the list in one of the categories, or just create a new category and add the software name. This ✨ means that the software is indeed open-source.

__Just because some software is free, that doesn't mean that it has paid features. It means that at least, you get basic functionality under a free license__
